# Spotify-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
In this project, we analyze Spotify music data using Python to uncover insights about song attributes, artists, and user listening behaviors. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to identify patterns in music preferences, the relationship between different song features and trends over time.
